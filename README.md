Getting data from the API using Retrofit and display using MVVM
Created the application using Kotlin and used some JetPack components like View Model, Live Data...
By using Retrofit we are making Http GET request and fetching the data from API
Showing the data using Recycler View and for better UI, I have used CardView.
